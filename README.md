### Password Manager Application

👨‍💻 **What was developed**

I developed a password manager application where users can:

- Register passwords for the online services they use.
- View their registered passwords and service information.
- Hide saved passwords.
- Remove previously stored data.

🔐 **Functionality**

In this project, I developed a React application to manage passwords. The application allows users to enter login and password information for various online services. The form for adding new passwords is conditionally rendered, appearing only after the user clicks on the button to add a new password. Additionally, there's functionality to hide/show all passwords stored in the manager.

🔍 **CRUD Operations**

The project involves dealing with the four main operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). While all operations will be utilized to some extent, the primary focus will be on Create, Read, and Delete functionalities. Editing functionality will not be implemented in this project.

⚛️ **Technologies and Tools**

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS
